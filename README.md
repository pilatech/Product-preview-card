## My process

- Firstly I looked at the desktop version layout to get an idea of how my markup should be authored
- I also had the mobile layout in the back of my mind so that I won't forget it totally
- Created my markup with focus on semantics but also keeping the visual layout in mind
- After creating the markup, I started writing my CSS for mobile
- After finishing mobile CSS, I started writing media query for desktop

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Some little Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I increased my confidence a notch when it comes to writing css

### Continued development

I just need to keep doing as many pure css projects as possible
